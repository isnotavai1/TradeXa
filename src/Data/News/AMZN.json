The goal? To preserve a good shopping experience while also fighting theft, a problem that’s impacting margins and causing safety concerns. The scope of the theft problem is hard to measure, though mentions of organized retail crime rose by 43% on earnings calls in the first half of 2023. To find clarity on this issue, Yahoo Finance explores a first of its kind, AI-driven heat map that could empower retailers to share real-time crime data with each other, and gets an exclusive look at the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the rise in organized retail crime, which they say is about much more than petty shoplifting. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.For more on our NEXT series, click here, and tune tune in to Yahoo Finance Live for more expert insight and the latest market action, Monday through Friday.","url":"https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=64c0174ab3e8028c11e30cd0ac24509b7b56d9cabe299809501ec05153e3d10e"},{"category":"company","datetime":1710754020,"headline":"US Prescriptions Race For Weight Loss Drugs - Eli Lilly's Zepbound Overtakes Novo Nordisk's Wegovy","id":126557984,"image":"","related":"AMZN","source":"Benzinga","summary":"Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

The 29-year-old co-founded Asian food startup Omsom with her sister, Kim. The company sells chef-crafted packaged noodles and sauces. So far, Omsom has managed to sell more than 4 million products and is available in more than 2,000 stores, including Whole Foods (AMZN), Target (TGT), and Sprouts (SFM). Pham and her sister, the daughters of Vietnamese refugees, were able to secure investors such as Away Co-founder and CEO Jen Rubio, Zola Co-founder and CEO Shan-Lyn Ma, and food-focused VC firm New Fare Partners Founder Elly Truesdell. At Omsom’s office in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Pham gives Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma a literal taste of how she leads her small team to shake up ethnic aisles and change the way consumers eat and think about Asian cuisine. “Omsom is all about being proud and loud, especially when the stereotype of Asian Americans in America's kind of like submissive, or docile,” Pham says. “Omsom is our true kind of energy and ethos and spirit.” Pham details not only how she and her sister have managed to build the brand at such a young age, but also how they were able to launch during the pandemic and endure the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held the business’s capital.

Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe’s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million. Later that year, Phil Knight stepped down as CEO and president of Nike, but continued his chairman role. 2012 Nike became the official supplier for NFL apparel. 2013 Nike became a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing Alcoa (AA). 2015 The company was named the official supplier for NBA apparel. 2016 Phil Knight officially stepped down from all duties with the company on June 30, 2016. 2019 In November 2019, Nike stopped selling directly through Amazon (AMZN), focusing more on direct relationships with customers. 2021 On November 5, 2021, Nike stock hit an all-time high, trading at $173.12 per share. With the stock down nearly 20% over the past year, as concerns over slowing sales growth and demand in China mount, investors are waiting for the next leg of innovation from the shoe company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.
