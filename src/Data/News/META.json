While some are excited, others point to the fact that the social media site isn't profitable, posting net losses of $90 million in 2023. Crunchbase News Senior Data Editor Gené Teare joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Reddit's upcoming IPO and what makes the platform unique in the social media sector. Teare lays out what the current sentiment for the stock is: \"I think the signals here are very mixed. I think some people feel like this is a little rich as a valuation. They're targeting I think on the upper end of about $6.4 billion, and that has us saying, if this is a company that can still grow 18 years in then it might not be so rich...Its revenues around $804 million last year and it did grow that 21%. So if it can keep growing its revenues then there is potential in the stock, but I think a lot of that revenue growth is more recent. So I think there's a lot of doubt around whether this is a little rich.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
